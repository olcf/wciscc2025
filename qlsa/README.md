# Quantum Linear Systems Algorithm

A sample implementation of a Quantum Linear Systems Algorithm (QLSA), the [Harrow–Hassidim–Lloyd (HHL)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.150502) algorithm, using [Qiskit's HHL implementation](https://learn.qiskit.org/course/ch-applications/solving-linear-systems-of-equations-using-hhl-and-its-qiskit-implementation). The implementation uses Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that utilize Qiskit libraries. The codes are designed to run the QLSA circuit on different quantum hardwares:
1. [IBM quantum-computing](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/)
2. [IQM](https://www.meetiqm.com/)

An application to fluid dynamics is also provided. The fluid dynamics use case follows the work of [Bharadwaj & Srinivasan (2020)](https://www.sto.nato.int/publications/STO%20Educational%20Notes/STO-EN-AVT-377/EN-AVT-377-01.pdf) and [Gopalakrishnan Meena et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0231929). 

# Running <a name="running"></a>

## Getting Started on Odo (Frontier)

The instructions below are mainly for **running interactively** on OLCF Odo. The first time you run the Python scripts, it may take some time to load the libraries.

The general workflow is to:

1. Start an interactive job (or batch job) to use Odo's compute nodes 
2. Load the appropriate Python `conda` environment 
3. Generate the circuit
4. Run the QLSA solver with the circuit you just generated
5. Analyze your results

### Running interactively

0. Clone the repository and `cd` into the `qlsa` directory (if you have not already)
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/olcf/wciscc2025.git
    cd wciscc2025
    cd qlsa
    ```
1. Start interactive job
    ```
    salloc -A trn037 -p batch -N 1 -t 1:00:00
    ```

2. Load Python environment:
    * When targeting real quantum backends, you must go through a [proxy server for connecting outside OLCF](https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/quantum/quantum_software/hybrid_hpc.html#batch-jobs) due to the Odo compute nodes being closed off from the internet by default. 
      ```
      source proxies.sh
      ```
    * First, load the relevant conda module:
      ```
      module load miniforge3/23.11.0
      ```
      How to activate the environment needed for circuit generation (the environment used in "Step 3"):
      ```
      source activate /gpfs/wolf2/olcf/trn037/proj-shared/81a/software/miniconda3-odo/envs/qlsa-circuit 
      ```
      How to activate the environment needed for circuit solver (the environment used in "Step 4"):
      ```
      source activate /gpfs/wolf2/olcf/trn037/proj-shared/81a/software/miniconda3-odo/envs/qlsa-solver
      ```

      > Note: you can only be in one active environment at a time. To switch between environments, you can use `source deactivate` followed by `source activate /path/to/a/give/env`

      
3. Run QLSA circuit generator script: [`circuit_HHL.py`](circuit_HHL.py)
    ```
    mkdir models
    srun -N1 -n1 -c1 python circuit_HHL.py -case sample-tridiag -casefile input_vars.yaml --savedata
    ```
    * **NOTE:** Make sure to save the circuit.
    * Make sure to have your `qlsa-circuit` conda environment activated.
    * Try different case settings in the case file [`input_vars.yaml`](input_vars.yaml).

4. Run the QLSA solver: [`solver.py`](solver.py)
    ```
    srun -N1 -n1 -c2 python solver.py -case sample-tridiag -casefile input_vars.yaml -s 1000 --savedata
    ```
    * Make sure to have your `qlsa-solver` conda environment activated.
    * Experiment with different parameters in the code.

5. Plot your results: [`plot_fidelity_vs_shots.py`](plot_fidelity_vs_shots.py)
    ```
    python plot_fidelity_vs_shots.py
    ```
  
> Note: Alternative to all of the above, you can use the batch script [`submit_odo.sh`](submit_odo.sh) to [submit a batch job on OLCF Odo](https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/systems/frontier_user_guide.html#batch-scripts) using `sbatch --export=NONE submit_odo.sh`. The `submit_odo.sh` example batch script is already setup with the above steps; however, modifying that file is required if you want to change any python script arguments.


## Running on real hardware

**NOTE:** To run using IQM machines, you need to add your IQM API KEY to the [`keys.sh`](keys.sh) file and `source` it. Although we will not be using IBM Quantum in the Winter Classic, this is the file you would put your IBM Quantum API key as well.

* Make sure to export key variables in your key file: `source keys.sh` . If you log out then log back in, you will need to do this again.
* Make sure to use the relevant `--backend_type` and `--backend_method` flags:
    * To submit a "mock" emulator job (can do this at any time): use `--backend_type real-iqm --backend_method garnet:mock`
    * To run during a "Pay-as-you-go" window: use `--backend_type real-iqm --backend_method garnet`
    * To run during a "Timeslot" window: use `--backend_type real-iqm --backend_method garnet:timeslot`
* On OLCF Odo's interactive or batch nodes, need to export proxies to connect outside OLCF. See instructions above.
* Running on IQM: 
    * There might be delays in returning the results due to availability of the resource.
    * Need to use a post-processing code to retrieve results from the IQM Resonance portal. See the code [solver_getjob.ipynb](solver_getjob.ipynb) below.

# Visualization

For your convience, we have provided a plotting script [`plot_fidelity_vs_shots.py`](plot_fidelity_vs_shots.py) to complete the HPC Crash Course challenges.


See the following Jupyter notebooks for example scripts on how to generate plots:

> Note: Although you won't be using OLCF's JupyterHub as part of the Winter Classic, these notebooks act as a examples for incorporating the proper python syntax into standalone python scripts.

* [solver_getjob.ipynb](solver_getjob.ipynb): for retrieving jobs from online portal of IBM and IQM.
* [plot_compare-backends.ipynb](plot_compare-backends.ipynb): visualizing the results from various backends.
* [plot_Hele-Shaw.ipynb](plot_Hele-Shaw.ipynb): visualizing the results for solving the 2D Hele-Shaw flow problem.


# Not Required: Installation

> WARNING: You do not need to follow these instructions for the Winter Classic. We provide instructions below for the sake of completeness and if you ever want to explore installing from scratch outside of Odo / the Winter Classic. Skip to the [Running the code](#running) section for getting started running the code.

All developments were done on [OLCF Odo](https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/systems/odo_user_guide.html) and macOS. Based on steps in [OLCF Docs](https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/quantum/quantum_software/hybrid_hpc.html#qiskit).

<details><summary>Notes for OLCF Odo:</summary>

  * Make sure to install your custom env in either `/ccsopen/proj/[projid]` or `/gpfs/wolf2/olcf/[projid]/proj-shared` (recommended). This is required to seamlessly run the plotting routines on OLCF JupyterHub.
  * Follow steps in [OLCF Docs](https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/quantum/quantum_software/hybrid_hpc.html#qiskit) to load the base conda env (DO NOT install Qiskit) 
    ```
    module load miniforge3
    ```
    * Use `source activate` and/or `source deactivate` instead of `conda activate` or `conda deactivate`.
  * Or the following for your own Miniconda installation
    ```
    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p /gpfs/wolf2/olcf/[projid]/proj-shared/[userid]/software/miniconda3-odo
    source /gpfs/wolf2/olcf/[projid]/proj-shared/[userid]/software/miniconda3-odo/bin/activate
    ```

      pip install qiskit-aer-gpu==0.15.1 --no-cache-dir
      ```
      * [Optional but recommended] Test the installation:

      ```
      * [Optional but recommended] Test the installation with the sample code provided: [`test_gpu.py`](test_gpu.py)

      </details>

      * Change `-backtyp` for different backends. Make sure to test all backend options offered.
      * **NOTE:** To run using IBM Provider (or IQM Resonance), you need to add your IBM Quantum Computing (or IQM) API KEY and instance to the [`keys.sh`](keys.sh) file and source activate it.

## 2. Run the HHL Circuit

1. Generate a circuit: [`circuit_HHL.py`](circuit_HHL.py)
      ```
      python circuit_HHL.py -case sample-tridiag -casefile input_vars.yaml --savedata
      ```
2. Run the circuit on a backend of your choosing: [`solver.py`](solver.py)
      * ***NOTE:*** Make sure to source your API tokens from the keys.sh file.
      ```
      python solver.py -case sample-tridiag -casefile input_vars.yaml -s 1000 --savedata --backend_type real-iqm --backend_method garnet:mock
      ```

> Warning: For our purposes, we "hacked" Qiskit's `backend_sampler_v2.py` to workaround IQM returning results in raw strings instead of bytes. The fixed routine is here: `/gpfs/wolf2/olcf/trn037/world-shared/backend_sampler_v2.py`. (in original lines 211/212, switched `num_bytes` to be the length of the string instead)
